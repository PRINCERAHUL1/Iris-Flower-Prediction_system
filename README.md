# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification  

## 📋 Description  
The **Iris Flower Classification System** is a machine learning-based project designed to classify iris flowers into three species (**Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**) based on petal and sepal measurements. This project demonstrates the power of **Logistic Regression** in predictive analytics.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔍 **Accurate Predictions**: Classifies iris flowers with **93% accuracy**.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes **Logistic Regression** for classification.  
- 🌟 **Interactive User Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a clean and interactive experience.  
- 📊 **User Data Input**: Accepts user input for petal and sepal dimensions.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Prediction**: Instantly displays classification results with visual feedback.

## 🎯 Dataset  
The **Iris Dataset** contains **150 instances** of iris flowers with the following features:  
- **Sepal Length** (cm)  
- **Sepal Width** (cm)  
- **Petal Length** (cm)  
- **Petal Width** (cm)  
- **Species**: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica  

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PRINCERAHUL1/Iris-Flower-Classification.git  
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification  
   ```  
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the Streamlit Application:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py  
   ```  

## 💞 Usage  
1. Enter the petal and sepal measurements in the application.  
2. The model predicts the species of the iris flower based on the input.  

## 🧬 Model Training  
- The model was trained using the **Scikit-learn** library.  
- **Logistic Regression** was chosen due to its high accuracy (93%) and efficiency.  
- Performance metrics include **accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

## 📊 Results  
- **Model Accuracy**: **93%**  
- Evaluation using **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**.
